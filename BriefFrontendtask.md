📝 Brief Note
Layout Approach:
I used a responsive two-column layout with Bootstrap’s grid system to display the product image and details side-by-side on larger screens, and stacked on smaller screens. The UI is clean and modular, with conditional rendering for stock availability and variant options.

Responsiveness Considerations:
The layout adapts gracefully to different screen sizes using Bootstrap’s grid classes. The product image scales with img-fluid, and form controls stack vertically on mobile for better usability. All elements are mobile-friendly and touch-accessible
